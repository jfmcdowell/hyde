I have been taking some much needed vacation over the past month. During time, I have been working my way through [Milan Guenther's] new book, [“Intersection: How Enterprise Design Bridges the Gap Between Business, Technology and People”]. I will do a more formal book review in the near future, but I wanted to share my initial thoughts:

1. The book is beautifully designed. If you are expecting a boring academic tome, look elsewhere. The colors pop, the typography is visually pleasing, and the layout utilizes plenty of white space for serial margin writers like me.

2. The book synthesizes disparate topics using design principles as the cement that binds them together. It introduces a framework to help bridge the gap and it is cohesive and actionable.

So far it is an easy and enjoyable read. The case studies are very interesting and artfully presented.
